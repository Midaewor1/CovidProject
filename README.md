# üìä COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores **global COVID-19 data** using SQL queries in **MySQL Workbench**.  
The goal is to showcase my ability to:
- Clean and structure real-world datasets  
- Write efficient SQL queries  
- Perform analytical calculations  
- Present insights that answer meaningful business/health questions  

Data source: *Our World in Data (OWID) ‚Äî COVID-19 dataset*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **IDE**: MySQL Workbench  
- **Language**: SQL  
- **Dataset**: COVID deaths & vaccination data

## üßæ Queries & Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Global Totals and Mortality Rate
```sql
SELECT SUM(new_cases) AS totalcases,
       SUM(new_deaths) AS totaldeaths,
       SUM(new_deaths) / SUM(new_cases) * 100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM coviddeathsdata_clean
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2;


2Ô∏è‚É£ Countries Ranked by Total Deaths
SELECT location, SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS SIGNED)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM coviddeathsdata_clean
WHERE continent IS NULL
  AND location NOT IN ('World', 'European Union', 'International')
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC;
Insight: Ranks countries by cumulative death count while excluding world/region aggregates.



3Ô∏è‚É£ Countries Ranked by Infection Rate
SELECT Location, Population, 
       MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, 
       MAX((total_cases / population)) * 100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM coviddeathsdata_clean
GROUP BY Location, Population
ORDER BY PercentPopulationInfected DESC;
Insight: Compares cases vs. population to show the percentage of the population infected at peak levels.


4Ô∏è‚É£ Infection Rate Over Time
SELECT Location, Population, date, 
       MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, 
       MAX((total_cases / population)) * 100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM coviddeathsdata_clean
GROUP BY Location, Population, date
ORDER BY PercentPopulationInfected DESC;
Insight: Tracks infection rate by country and date, showing peak infection levels over time.


üöÄ Key Skills Demonstrated
Aggregate functions (SUM, MAX)
Data cleaning (CAST, filtering NULLs, excluding aggregates)
Comparative analysis across countries and continents
Producing clear, business-relevant insights from raw data


üìà Next Steps
Add visualizations (Tableau/Power BI)
Extend analysis with vaccination progress vs. infection rates
Build an ETL pipeline for automated updates
